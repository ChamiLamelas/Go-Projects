## Running the Server

### Compilation Method 

TODO: add compilation instructions 

### Direct Execution 

TODO: add direction execution instructions

    > Note you will see `exit status 0xc000013a` (Windows) or `^Csignal: interrupt` (Linux) which is expected. This just means the program was aborted by a manual `Ctrl + C`.

## Example Interaction

## Platforms

This was implemented on Windows 10 using `go version go1.23.0 windows/amd64` and [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/). 

It was tested on the above Windows platform as well as on Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS using `go version go1.23.0 linux/amd64`.

For more details on testing, see [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md)
